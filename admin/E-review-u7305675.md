Component: <getAllResourcesList etc.>

### Comments 

<The series code written by Wangtao Jia, represented by getAllResourcesList, attempt to get a list of String which represent all the coordinates for an element(Resources, island or stones), has come really helpful when we try to visualise the string in the viewer in task 5. However, the code can also be improbved since most of them have the same structure so personally I consider these can maybe be done in fewer lines of code, with an extra input, for example, string that represents type of the elements we are looking for. >
